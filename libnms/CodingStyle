Since it isn't a kernel and code manages to get quite complex we aren't using
Linus coding style. Do not point me his arguments about tabs and such.

Rules:

- no hard tabs, I'll purge any \t in the source soon
- 4char indent
- 79 col per line

In short the code should match the FFmpeg coding style.
